## Method to Make:

### Connecting the Four-Gear Motors to the L298N Motor Driver: üî£
- Connect the two right motor Red wires to the ‚ÄúOUT4‚Äù terminals on the L298N motor driver.
- Connect the two right motor Black wires to the ‚ÄúOUT3‚Äù terminals on the motor driver.
- Connect the two left motor Black wires to the ‚ÄúOUT2‚Äù terminals on the motor driver.
- Connect the two left motor Red wires to the ‚ÄúOUT1‚Äù terminals on the motor driver.

### Connecting the Four Inputs of the L298N Motor Driver to the Arduino UNO Board:
- Connect the IN1 pin of the motor driver to digital pin D4 on the Arduino.
- Connect the IN2 pin of the motor driver to digital pin D5 on the Arduino.
- Connect the IN3 pin of the motor driver to digital pin D6 on the Arduino.
- Connect the IN4 pin of the motor driver to digital pin D7 on the Arduino.

### Attaching the SG90 Servo Motor to the Chassis and Connecting It to the Arduino Board: ‚öôÔ∏è
- Connect the Signal (Orange Wire) from the servo motor to a digital pin D10 on the Arduino.
- Connect the VCC (Red Wire) from the servo motor to the 5V pin on the Arduino.
- Connect the GND (Brown Wire) from the servo motor to the GND pin on the Arduino.

### Connecting the Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04) with the Arduino Board: üìü
- Connect the VCC (power) pin of the ultrasonic sensor to the 5V pin on the Arduino.
- Connect the GND (ground) pin of the sensor to the GND pin on the Arduino.
- Connect the TRIG (trigger) pin of the ultrasonic sensor to Analog pin A1 on the Arduino.
- Connect the ECHO pin of the sensor to another Analog pin A2 on the Arduino.

### Connect the Battery Power Connection: üîã
- Connect the Red wire (+) of the battery holder to the 12V In of the L298N Motor Driver and to the VIN Pin of the Arduino board.
- Connect the Black wire (-) of the battery holder to the GND In of the L298N Motor Driver and to the GND Pin of the Arduino board.
